Dice Challenge with DOM in JS

This is my first challenge with DOM

I used querySelectorAll, querySelector, setAttribute

When Player1's number is bigger than Player2's number, then title change into "Player1 is wins"
![player 1 wins](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113966724/207506613-ed3c83ec-5cc2-49e5-a719-735a87e4987e.png)

the other way around, it becomes "Player2 is Wins"
![player 2 wins](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113966724/207506616-9866bbdc-c860-4e3c-a6e5-fcc0f88ad2af.png)

When Player1 and Player2 have same number, title shows "Draw"
![draw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113966724/207506621-da9d25e1-b492-4c40-9984-5fd7f6b02273.png)
